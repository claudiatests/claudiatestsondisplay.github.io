Due to their narrowly defined idea of taste, the jury of the 1863 Paris Salon rejected almost half of the works submitted. Facing rejection, artists who had not been accepted to the Salon in 1863 joined forces to protest. Their claims would be answered by the Emperor himself, granting them a space to display their works: the Salon des Refusés. Since then, multiple spaces have been created to showcase those artworks that have been excluded from the traditional canon. Today, On Display revisits the concept of rejection and expands upon it, exploring broader boundaries that challenge what art “deserves” to be exhibited.

As viewership continually expands and artists breaking away from conventions, how could we then define what is acceptable and what is not? On Display opens this discussion through three avenues: not only art that is rejected from previous exhibitions, but also the rejection of materials to conform to the artist’s initial vision for their piece, as well as the artists’ own rejection of what they produce. In this way, the opinions of the jury, the artist, the material, and the public collide, producing a space that fruitfully reflects the ever-expanding limits of contemporary art.
